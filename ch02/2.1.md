##2.1

###a

double precision element is 8B and the block size is 64B, it can hold 8 element.
so we can divide the matrix to 4 8x8 matrix, then the minimum size of the cache for 2 8x8 matrix is:

2 x 8 x 8 x 8B = 1KB

###b

#####The block version:

When visiting the 8x8 matrix, each row will evoke one miss, the first column will evoke 8 misses,
but they will be cached up, so ,the totall misses for one 8x8 matrix is:

8 + 8

#####The unblock version

64B block can hold 8 element , when visiting a row of 256 elements, the missrate is 1/8
but when visiting columns, one visit will evoke a miss and after 256 visits of a column,
the 16KB cache is full and next column will evoke misses too.
so the totall misses for one 8x8 matrix is:

8x8+8

so 9 misses for the unblock version compared to 2 misses for the block version.

###c

```
for(int ii=0;i<N;i+=B){
	for(int jj=0;j<N;j+=B){
		for(int i=ii;i<min(N,ii+B);i++){
			for(int j=jj;j<min(N,jj+B);j++){
				output[i][j]=input[j][i];
			}
		}
	}
}
```

###d
2 way set associative.

###e
the result is related to the band width of the l2 cache and the size to l1 cache of the computer.
